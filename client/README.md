Finished - 9/27/24
This version is very much based off of the blog app done in class, but while adding expense things to it. 

i must give credit to jose, tony, aaron, neng, for using their codes as references, and a huge thanks to tony for helping me a lot throughout this whole project.

i had many setbacks when making this project. even the name itself 'V2' isn't really a V2, more like a V4.

i want to come back to this in the future and remake it from the ground up. i know what i struggled with, and how i can improve. i'll strive to do better in my projects moving forward.
